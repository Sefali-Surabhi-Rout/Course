Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.


Sefali Surabhi Rout
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
These are algorithmic techniques used to solve problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems, solving the subproblems independently, and combining the solutions to the subproblems to obtain a solution to the original problem. This approach reduces the size of the problem and makes it easier to find solutions.
